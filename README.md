#__GitHub URL Tutorial__

>_A Git repository is of very little use if it resides entirely on your remote GitHub or GitLab account. To actually work with the various files and resources stored in that repository, you need to pull or clone that code from the remote repo to your local machine. And to do that, you need to find the GitHub URL and use it._

##To use a GitHub URL, follow these steps:
~~~~
1. On the GitHub website, click on you repository of interest.
2. Locate the green button named Code and click on it. The GitHub URL will appear.
3. Copy the GitHub URL.
4. Open a Git client such as the BASH shell or GitHub Desktop on your local machine.
5. Use the GitHub URL to clone the remote repo.
~~~~

Once the remote repository is cloned, you can pretty much forget about the GitHub URL. Git saves the URL for you, so all future push and pull commands will know which remote repo to to interact with.
